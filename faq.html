        <strong>Mastering is the final stage of audio production before the
                music is released/manufactured/distributed.</strong>
              <p>Through the use of EQ, limiting and other audio processing tools,
              a mastering engineer will ensure that the music delivers a
              cohesive listening experience from song to song. Even music that
              is heavily scrutinized in the mixing process can benefit from
              mastering - it's one last set of experienced ears that will hear
              the album in it's entirety, then help determine the best overall
              loudness/level, spacing between songs (on all mediums) and overall
              sound of the music.</p>

        <h5>FILE TYPE</h5>

            <strong>
              WAV or AIFF files in the sample rate and bit depth of the mix
              session.
            </strong>
            <p>
              (Most commonly 24bit and 44.1k or 48k sampling rates, but anything
              up to 192khz). Note that upsampling your mixes will not add
              “quality” to your music. If your project has mixes in different
              sample rates, still deliver them in the native session settings
              and I will determine the best course during mastering.
            </p>

            <h5>LEVELS</h5>
            <strong
              >Ideally -20 to -15 as a LUFS or RMS reading, peaking somewhere
              around -4dbfs.
            </strong>
            <p>
              If you don't have a way of confidently measuring loudness or
              level, I might suggest importing and viewing the mixes in your
              DAW. Your goal is to preserve some of the dynamic range that
              occurs naturally in most music which would provide ample
              “headroom” for the mastering engineer room to maneuver.

              <li>WAV files (stereo) in highest sample rate that was delivered to me.  This is most commonly 2444 or 2448, suitable for digital distribution.</li>
              <li>WAV files - 16bit, 44.1khz (stereo) CD “quality”. Some online distributors insist on this file type.</li>
              <li>MP3's (320mbps).  Best for preview, web, email, etc.</li>
              <li>A DDP file.  "Disc Description Protocol" is a collection of files (in a .zip file) that you can use to manufacture physical CD's. Remember those?  It is also an excellent way to preview your entire album: audio, spacing, CD-TEXT, ISRC, UPC.  I recommend this free DDP player for both Mac and PC: <a href="https://o.steinberg.net/en/support/content_and_accessories/ddp_player.html" target="_blank">Steinberg DDP Player</a> </li>

        <strong>An ISRC Code (International Standard Recording Code) is a unique 12-digit number issued per song that acts as a permanent identifier for a specific sound recording. </strong> <p>ISRC are used by digital platforms and collecting agencies for royalty collection and categorization.</p>

            <strong>DO I NEED ISRC CODES TO HAVE MY MUSIC MASTERED:</strong>
            <p>No, not to do the audio portion of the mastering work.  If your project will be distributed online, you will have to provide ISRCs to the distributor or have them assign them for you.  Streaming services require them.  The reason ISRC is confusing is due to the CD format.  Mastering engineers can add ISRC to the metadata in the DDP/CD-layout, not to the files themselves, but usually the mastering work is completed prior to the digital distribution gets going. </p>
