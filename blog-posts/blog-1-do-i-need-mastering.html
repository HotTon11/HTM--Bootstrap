        Creative work like music and art, are subjective - they are “subject” to
        or attached to a personal feeling. And different people have different
        tastes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, etc. And so if your music
        sounds exactly how you want it to sound, your album is done, right? From
        a listening perspective, the answer might be “yes”, but beyond the many
        musical adjustments that can be made during the mastering process,
        exists a number of technical, organizational and QC (quality control)
        items to check before releasing your music.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Levels & Loudness</em> - Mastering engineers use various tools and
          meters to measure levels (RMS) and loudness (LUFS) and can provide
          different file sets depending on how you intend to release your music.
          Oftentimes, a one-file-fits-all approach is sufficient, sometimes it
          is not.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Sample Rate/Bit Depth and File Management</em> - Be mindful of
          these settings as you may need to provide different sets of files
          depending on what you are doing with them. For example, CDs are 16
          bit, 44.1khz (a.k.a. Redbook) and are most commonly delivered as a DDP
          (Disc Description Protocol). Online players/distributors may prefer
          higher sample rates and resolution when available, especially as more
          HD streaming services are becoming available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Quality Control (QC)</em> - Make sure the songs are free from
          instrument buzz, mouth clicks, hiss, and other noises that can be
          especially apparent to a mastering engineer at the project layout
          stage. We have fancy denoising software, can draw specific fade in’s
          and out’s and even apply automation to help decrease or disguise a
          noisy track.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Balance & Consistency</em> - The goal of all this is to create a
          consistent listening experience from song to song in any listening
          environment. Even highly skilled mixers will send their files to a
          trusted mastering engineer for a final objective listen and to provide
          some of the work discussed above. Finally, make sure all of your
          tracks are consistent across all platforms with regard to “tops &
          tails”. At the top, I like to leave 250-300ms at the start of every
          file before the first music is heard. At the tail, l leave enough
          space to where I believe the next song should start, minus 250-300ms!
        </li>
      </ul>
