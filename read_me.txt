This site is a recreation of my main live website designed by a professional using Wordpress/Elementor.  

The purpose of this site is to show a Bootstrap 5 re-creation design that includes many standard components - navbar, buttons, accordions, forms etc.  

Little bit of Javascript to show CURRENTYEAR on footer.

The code is largely based on tutorials:
Traversy Media
NetNinja
Udemy
